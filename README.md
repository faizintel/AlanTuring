The way to find out it a machine is artificially intelligent
Turing test was developed by Alan Turing in order to determine if a machine is artificially intelligent. 
So bbasically this was created in 1950's. 

There were intelligent people who wanted to work with artificial intelligence more than 5 decades agao. But at that time the technology was not that developed. 

But now it is possible to create partial artificial intelligence. Now there will come a time in the near future when we will hopefully see a good artificial intelligence.
